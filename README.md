#ECO

Just a silly js game experiment by Roel & Caroline


#setup

$ npm install
$ npm install --global gulp-cli
$ gulp


#development cycle

1) make changes to the javascript and css files in ./src/
2) use the "gulp" command to compile those changes into ./dist/
3) open index.html to run the project

other options:
$ gulp dev // this will build the javascript without compression, making it easier to debug in the browser dev tools
